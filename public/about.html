<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’ve been working as a Technical Support Engineer in a fintech environment where PostgreSQL sits at the core of most issues I handle. I regularly work on query optimization, indexing decisions, and execution-plan analysis, using logs and metrics to track down performance bottlenecks. I’m comfortable working from the command line, investigating issues across the stack, and I’ve used POPSQL in production to analyze datasets and validate query behavior. My background is customer-facing, so I focus on owning issues end to end and explaining complex problems in a clear, practical way.</p>
